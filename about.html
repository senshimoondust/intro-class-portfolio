      Greetings! Thanks for stopping by. I am an aspiring software engineer
      finding my way into the tech space. I acquired my B.A in Media Studies
      from the City University of New York, Queens College in 2020. I am a
      recent transplant from New York City to Seattle. <br />
      I am currently a sales manager at the Macy's Furniture Gallery and most of
      my professional experience is in customer service and office
      administration. My goal is to pursue a career as a full stack developer
      with the possibility of specializing in cybersecurity.
